Introduction
Cell Machine is a game that combines elements of programming, automation, and puzzle-solving. Your goal is to create complex cellular automata by placing and configuring cells on a grid, and then observing how they interact with each other based on a set of rules. The challenge lies in optimizing your design to achieve specific objectives, such as generating specific patterns, achieving stable states, or even simulating simple computations.

Gameplay
The game consists of levels with varying degrees of complexity. Each level presents you with a grid where you can place different types of cells. Cells can have different behaviors and interactions based on their configuration and placement. Your objective is to manipulate these cells to achieve the desired outcome using the least number of moves.

Features
Engaging Puzzles: Enjoy a wide range of challenging puzzles that test your creativity and logical thinking.

Cell Variety: Use different types of cells, each with its own unique behavior, to create intricate automata.

Progressive Difficulty: Start with simple levels and gradually advance to more complex challenges as you master the mechanics.

Sandbox Mode: Unleash your creativity by experimenting with cells and automata without constraints.

Achievements: Earn achievements for completing levels with the fewest moves, shortest time, and more.

How to Play
Objective: Understand the level's objective before you begin. It could be creating a specific pattern, achieving a stable state, or any other goal.

Placing Cells: Drag and drop cells from the side panel onto the grid. You can rotate cells and adjust their properties.

Simulating: Once you've placed your cells, initiate the simulation and observe how they interact based on the predefined rules.

Iterate and Refine: If your solution doesn't work as expected, modify the placement and properties of the cells, and try again.

Completion: Successfully achieve the level's objective using the fewest moves possible.
